"""Shared state + helpers for route modules.

This is the single source of truth for:
  - `active_connections`  — main WS clients (`/ws`) receiving VRM commands
  - `status_connections`  — status-page WS clients (`/ws_status`)
  - `latest_uploaded_image` — set by `/upload-image/` (currently unwired —
    a relic of v1, will be revived in the UI-wiring milestone)
  - `_vr_position`        — last-known VR headset pose
  - `notify_clients`      — broadcast a dict to every `/ws` client
  - `broadcast_status`    — broadcast a client-count update to `/ws_status`
  - `send_transcription_result` — push transcription text to `/ws` clients
    (the client at `ui.js:24` listens for this; not yet emitted by any route
    in v2, but kept here so wiring the voice input back up is a one-import job)
